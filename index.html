    <p id="introduction"><i><b>South Korea, country in East Asia. It occupies the southern portion of the Korean
                peninsula. The country is
                bordered by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) to the north, the East Sea (Sea of
                Japan) to the east, the East China Sea to the south, and the Yellow Sea to the west; to the southeast it
                is separated from the Japanese island of Tsushima by the Korea Strait. South Korea makes up about 45
                percent of the peninsula’s land area. The capital is Seoul (Sŏul).Seoul's NamdaemunAfter being destroyed
                by fire in 2008, Seoul's Namdaemun (“Great South Gate”) was restored and reopened in 2013.South Korea
                faces North Korea across a demilitarized zone (DMZ) 2.5 miles (4 km) wide that was established by the
                terms of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting in the Korean War (1950–53). The DMZ, which runs for
                about 150 miles (240 km), constitutes the 1953 military cease-fire line and roughly follows latitude 38°
                N (the 38th parallel) from the mouth of the Han River on the west coast of the Korean peninsula to a
                little south of the North Korean town of Kosŏng on the east coast.

                                        T’aebaek Mountains, and they flow between the ranges before entering their
                                        lowland plains.
                                        Nearly all the country’s rivers flow westward or southward into either the
                                        Yellow Sea or the
                                        East China Sea; only a few short, swift rivers drain eastward from the T’aebaek
                                        Mountains. The
                                        Naktong River, South Korea’s longest, runs southward for 325 miles (523 km) to
                                        the Korea Strait.
                                        Streamflow is highly variable, being greatest during the wet summer months and
                                        considerably less
                                        in the relatively dry winter.</b></i>
